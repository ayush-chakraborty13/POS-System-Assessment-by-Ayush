Parts of Speech Assessment Using NLP
Overview
This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) by conducting a detailed Parts of Speech (POS) assessment using the classic text, "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to perform POS tagging and analyses the frequency and roles of different parts of speech within the text.

Features
Installation and setup of the SpaCy NLP library.
Loading and tokenization of text data.
POS tagging each token and analyzing sentence structures.
Frequency analysis of various POS tags in the text.
Detailed dependency parsing to visualize sentence structure.
Identification and display of named entities.
Installation
